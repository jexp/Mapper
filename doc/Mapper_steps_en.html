<h3>Manual for installing and starting the MAPPER</h3>
<H4>Installation</H4>
<ul>
<li>extract the file <a href="../makros/mapper.tgz">mapper.tgz</a> in a directory of your choice e.g. <code>/home/mh14/mak</code> (this is the example directory to which I refer in this manual)
<li>if not installed you have to install Java for your platform, as the applet is not able to store anything due to security restrictions
<li>the <a href="../makros/icons.zip">icons</a> should be extracted to the same directory
<li>there are startfiles for Linux (<code>startMapper</code>) and Windows (<code>startMapper.bat</code>), there you have to adapt the path where to find the java executable, if it is contained in your PATH environment variable you may even remove the prepended path
<li>to point the Mapper to the location of the maps you have to <strong>copy</strong> the <strong>single line</strong> fromt he file <code>mapper.def</code> that reads <code>url=file://localhost/home/mh14/mak/maps</code> to your own configuration file named <code>mapper.ini</code>
<li>then you must adapt this URL to the correct location (the installation directory or the directory where the subdirectory <code>maps</code> can be found)
<li>to start with mapping a MUD you have to <strong>copy</strong> the directory named <code>default</code> in the <code>maps</code> Directory to another name (e.g the name of your MUD (e.g. <code>yourmud.org</code>)
<li><strong>installation is done</strong>
<H4>Tips for starting</H4>
<li>Run:
<li>Linux: startMapper demo_en
<li>Windows: startMapper.bat demo_en
<li>the parameter <code>demo_en</code> refers to the directory name where the maps for the wanted MUD are located (e.g. <code>yourmud.org</code>)
<li>the Mapper listens on port 2000 (default) at localhost
<li>all commands that are sent there are, executed as if the were typed in the command line
<H4>Usage</H4>
<li>the Mapper is operated by using the menus, the buttons or the command line
<li>Help can be requested by typing "?" or by using the "Help" menu
<li>or your look at the <a href="Mapper_en.html">documentation page</a> where an almost (!!) complete documentation can be found
<li>for the beginning some commands are listed here:
<ul>
<li><code>ae n e se</code>: create exits
<li><code>se</code>: move in that direction
<li><code>g 5</code>: jump to node number five (names are also possible)
<li><code>
am Cave
</code>
: create a new map with this name
<li><code>
sm Cave
</code>
: switch to the given map
<li><code>
ai short A dark room
</code>
: save the given text for a key word (e.g. short) for the actual node
<li><code>
zoom nodes 5
</code>
: zoom that at least 5 nodes are visible
<li><code>
click with the right mouse button or twice with the left one
</code>
: jump to the clicked node
<li><code>
shift and click left or shift and drag
</code>
: mark nodes
<li><code>
ctrl and click left or ctrl and drag
</code>
: zoom in, ctrl and right click zooms out (or use the zoom button)
<li>the mapper <strong>won't save automatically!</strong> therefore use <code>
save
</code>
<li>quit with <code>
Q
</code>
<li>.... look in the help, there you can find almost everything (or at the <a href="Mapper_de.html">web page</a>)
<H4>Using with TF</H4>
<li>If my tf <a href="../index.html">packages</a> are used, the file  <a href="../expert/source/mapper.tf">mapper.tf</a> does the connection to the mapper (by sending commands to the mapper port), otherwise you find there the examples to build your own mapper-connection
<li>the packages support the mapper themselves (walk along, jump to way-node (don't forget give the nodes in the mapper the same name like in the routing system using <code>ai ways knotenname</code> the same
 denselben Namen wie im Wegesystem verpassen), draw while walking, saving of information)
<li>for initializing the connection <code>/init_mapper</code> has to be called, there a world for the mapper is created and connected to
<li>the variable <code>mapper</code> is set to <code>1</code>, if you want to suppress sending information to the mapper temporarily you may set it to <code>0</code>
</ul>

If you encounter any bug or missing localization or if you have ideas for easing the use of the mapper or extending its functionality send me an e-mail. Please attach a log of the java-console when refering to bugs.
