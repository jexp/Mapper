syn3 if a node of another map is given the -m option is required
syn4 for exits without a direction -d0 has to be used otherwise the direction can be given like -dse (southeast)
syn5 if the arguments are given without the mentioned options, than these arguments containing references to exits or nodes do just work for the actual map and no special exists can be used. but even there ids or names are possible (e.g. ae n nw s se u -> addExit north northwest ...)<p>
syn6 when using the commands ae, DP, DE, MP the substring of "marked" necessary for identification can be used to have the command work on the marked nodes<br>
